            <p>
                <center>Palak paneer is one of the all-time most
                    beloved Indian recipes. Rich with spices, spinach, and fresh-pressed
                    cheese that squeaks delightfully with each bite, palak paneer is a gluten-free dish packed
                    with flavor and gentle heat from garlic and chilies.</center>
